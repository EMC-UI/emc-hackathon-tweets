## Step 01

You have some *basic* building blocks you need here to build a complete web app:

1. index.html - You have a simple hello world UI, plus angular.js and app.js files included
2. app.js - Your angular code goes here
3. server.js - Your server code goes here
4. angular.js - Angular.js 1.5 library


### Tips:
* Try getting a simple [express](https://expressjs.com/) server running
* Experiment with the [twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/tools/console)
* Try running your server by typing `node server.js`.  It won't do too much yet
* You can view your `index.html` file in a browser, by choosing file -> open -> index.html

### The rest is up to you.  Get busy!
